            <p>
              My name is Kellen Bavis and I am currently a Senior at the
              University at Albany. I was inspired to begin my fitness journey
              my Freshman Year of College. I was a scrawny, 110lb young man
              coming into school. I decided that it was time to start making
              changes in my life. With the workout routines and nutrition plans
              that I will be sharing, I was able to gain 50 lbs of lean muscle.
              While altering my daily routine to be more healthy, the positive
              impact it has had on my life outside of this journey is
              immeasurable.
